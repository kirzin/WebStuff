Very calm and sweet personality once he gets to know you. Love to cuddle, touch and play with humans. He prefers a quiet place and enjoys a gentle game. We thought of releasing them after neutering them but they are so sweet and affectionate that we decided to try finding them home instead. He has a sister, Floofie. Both are litter box trained, neutered, microchipped, and are up to date on vaccinations. (need another shot shortly) Treated for fleas and worms, too.Their adoption fee is ₱2,608.52. We want to make sure they are adopted into a family that can really enjoy his company. Please contact me at 808 397 6639 for more info or to schedule a visit. Mahalo!
